KNOWLEDGE TEST

In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/1503, IGIA will conduct a Knowledge Test prior to 
the Investor's first Investment to verify whether the crowdfunding services offered are 
appropriate for potential, non-sophisticated investors. If the Investor's answers are 
deemed insufficient or incomplete by IGIA, a specific warning regarding the risk of 
total loss of the invested capital will be presented to the Investor after completing 
the Knowledge Test and prior to each investment.

The questions in the Knowledge Test are used to assess the Member's investment 
experience and objectives, as well as to define their financial standing. 
Members may modify their answers, particularly if their circumstances change. 
They will have access to a new Knowledge Test by simply requesting it by email 
to IGIA (contact@igia.com), or via their personal account, and at least every two years.

A summary of the answers to the Knowledge Test questions will be generated after the Test is completed. 
The Member must complete this Test. The Knowledge Test will be available at any time in the Member's Personal Space.

ACCESS TO SERVICES
The Investor has access to the Services - it should be noted that all Investors must first be Members. 
To use the Services, the Investor must (i) hold a Euro Bank Account, (ii) have a Personal Space, 
(iii) successfully open a Payment Account with the Payment Service Provider, 
and (iv) ensure that their Payment Account is credited with the Subscription amount. 
As part of accessing the Services, the investor expressly agrees to subscribe to the IGIA newsletter. 
They have the right to unsubscribe from this newsletter.

ACCESS TO SERVICES
IGIA provides the Services consisting of (i) connecting, through the Website, Project Owners and 
Investors financing Projects, (ii) defining and organizing the terms and conditions of Project 
Financing Transactions, and (iii) defining and organizing the terms and conditions for 
monitoring and managing these Financing Transactions.

IGIA does not provide payment services; these are provided entirely by the Payment Service Provider.

Members/Investors have access to a detailed presentation of the Crowdfunding Offer for each 
Project Owner as part of the Services, including:

Details of the Crowdfunding Offer (the name of the Project Owner and a brief description of 
their business, the amount sought, the closing date for subscriptions, the nominal amount, 
the intended use of the loaned funds, etc.),
a detailed description of the Project Owner's business and its outlook,
information relating to the Project Owner's financial and legal situation and their outlook,
information on the Project Owner's officers, directors, and shareholders/partners,
where applicable, the Terms and Conditions, Memorandum, Shareholders' Agreement, 
or Loan Agreement of the Crowdfunding Offer
the FICI.
This information is published by each Project Owner under their own responsibility. 
In accordance with regulations, IGIA checks the consistency, clarity 
(non-technical and unambiguous language), and balance of this information.

IGIA supplements this information by integrating the following aspects into the FICI:

the procedures for collecting and transmitting subscription or registration certificates,
the risks inherent in a Crowdfunding Offer for the Investor.
All Regulatory Documentation available on the Website will be downloadable, including 
the texts in a printable and non-editable version. These will always correspond to 
the latest version validated by the Project Owner.

On each Project Page, a document entitled "FICI" allows the Member to view and download 
the FICI relating to the Crowdfunding Offer. The Client/Member/Investor expressly 
declares that they have read the FICI and fully agree to it prior to any Offer and 
any Financing Transaction. If the Client/Member/Investor does not fully agree to 
the provisions of the FICI, they must then refrain from making any Offer and participating in any Financing Transaction.

COMPLETING THE SUBSCRIPTION BY THE INVESTOR
Subscribing is reserved for Members/Investors. The process is, with some exceptions, 
entirely electronic and supervised by a secure environment.

The Investor can make a Subscription using a form located on the Project Page, 
allowing them to choose the amount they wish to invest. They confirm this amount by clicking the "Validate" button.

If the balance in their Payment Account is insufficient, the Investor will 
be asked to make a transfer or credit by credit card to credit their 
Payment Account with the amount corresponding to the Subscription. 
The Investor can only lend the amounts credited to their Payment Account.

The Investor will then be directed to a new page to confirm their choice. 
This page summarizes the essential information related to their investment as follows:

Amount;
Gross annual interest rate (if applicable);
Term (if applicable);
Maturities (if applicable);

Offer type.

If the information provided corresponds to the investment the Investor wishes to make, the Investor clicks the "Confirm" button.

This action also constitutes acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Use, 
confirmation that the information about them contained in the Knowledge Test is still accurate, 
and confirmation by the Investor that they have read the FICI's terms and conditions.

By clicking "Confirm my investment," the Investor will receive an email containing 
their Subscription information. This document is also available from their Personal Account.

The Subscription made by the Investor is revocable for a period of four days 
(the "Reflection Period"). Once this period has passed, the Investor may no longer 
withdraw: they have irrevocably committed to investing under the terms set out in the Offer. 
Only the decision by IGIA to cancel the Crowdfunding Offer and/or the Investor's 
Offer may prevent the conclusion of the Financing Transaction.

CHANGES TO REGULATORY DOCUMENTATION DURING THE FUNDRAISING PERIOD

The Project Owner undertakes to notify IGIA of any changes to the information in order 
to keep the FICI constantly up to date and for the entire duration of the Crowdfunding 
Offer (the fundraising period). IGIA will immediately inform investors who have subscribed 
or expressed interest in the crowdfunding offer of any material changes to the information 
contained in the FICI that have been notified to it. This information will be sent by email 
with the subject line: Changes to the key investment information sheet + identification of the project concerned.

MODIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF AN INACCURACY, OMISSION, OR ERROR FOUND BY IGIA

If IGIA detects an omission, error, or inaccuracy in the FICI that could have a substantial 
impact on the expected return on investment, IGIA will promptly notify the Project Owner of 
this omission, error, or inaccuracy, who will complete or correct the information in question as soon as possible.

If such an addition or correction has not been made promptly, IGIA will suspend the 
Crowdfunding Offer until the FICI has been completed or corrected, but within a period not exceeding thirty calendar days.

IGIA will immediately inform investors who have made a Subscription or expressed interest 
in the Crowdfunding Offer by email of such irregularities, of the measures taken and to 
be taken by IGIA, and of their right to withdraw their investment offer or expression of interest in the Crowdfunding Offer.

If, after thirty calendar days, the FICI has not been completed or corrected to rectify 
all identified irregularities, the Crowdfunding Offer will be canceled.

Unless the Investor submits a cancellation request within a reasonable timeframe, any Subscription will be deemed confirmed.

END OF THE FUNDRAISING
The Fundraising Period is determined by IGIA, which sets its start, end, and duration. 
Once the Desired Amount is reached, IGIA will note the total amount of valid Subscriptions received at the end of the Fundraising Period.

Investors will receive confirmation of the success of the Crowdfunding Offer and therefore 
the allocation of Securities or Loans within a reasonable timeframe by means of a certificate accessible in their personal space.

At the end of the Fundraising Period, if IGIA does not decide to extend it and if the 
Desired Amount is not reached, Investors will receive an email confirming the 
cancellation of their Subscription. The Subscribed Amounts will be returned in 
full to the Investors' Payment Account within 5 business days by the Payment Service Provider, free of charge.

In the event of Premature Termination of the Crowdfunding Offer or cancellation of the 
Crowdfunding Offer due to Force Majeure, all Offers will be canceled, and within 5 business days, 
an information email will be sent by IGIA to all affected Investors. The Subscribed Amounts 
will then be returned in full to the Investors' Payment Account within the following 5 business days by the Payment Service Provider.

If the Desired Amount is reached before the expiration of the Fundraising Period, 
the online subscription will be interrupted. No additional Subscriptions will then be possible (except in the event of a computer error).

IGIA will then note the total amount of valid Subscriptions received, as well as the early 
closure of the Fundraising Period. Investors will receive confirmation of the success of the Crowdfunding Offer.

IGIA is duly mandated by the Investor to release the Payment Service Provider 
from its obligation to retain the Subscribed Amount at the end of the Collection 
Period and to instruct it to pay said amount as follows:

If, at the end of the Collection Period, the amount of Subscriptions and sums 
received by the Payment Service Provider is equal to the Desired Amount, 
the Desired Amount (net of any commissions charged by the Payment Service 
Provider or by IGIA) will be paid to the Project Owner after providing IGIA 
with proof of registration of the Securities in a register maintained by it or after validating the list of Investors;
In the event of Premature Termination of the Crowdfunding Offer or if, 
at the end of the Fundraising Period, the total amount of 
Subscriptions and sums received by the Payment Service Provider 
is strictly less than the Desired Amount, the Payment Service 
Provider will reimburse the Investor(s) for the Subscribed Amount paid by the latter.

RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL

Each Client/Member/Investor has a period of four (4) calendar days 
from the date of completion of their Subscription to exercise their 
right of withdrawal, without having to provide a reason or incur any penalties. 
They can do so directly from their personal account.

Information regarding the cooling-off period is provided in the 
"Read before investing" pop-up in their Personal Account, as well as in the introduction to the FICI. 
Investors receive information regarding the start of the cooling-off period immediately after their Subscription. 
Investors who have completed a Subscription will have the option to cancel said Subscription from their dashboard. 
During the four-calendar-day period, they will have access to a "Cooling-off period: cancel my offer" 
link in the box dedicated to the financed project. By clicking this button, the Investor 
immediately cancels their Subscription and will see a pop-up informing them that their 
Subscription has been canceled. After the 4 calendar day period, the link is no longer visible.

MEMBER AND INVESTOR OBLIGATIONS
The Member/Investor is generally obligated to (i) comply with the Site's access conditions, 
(ii) provide accurate and truthful information regarding their civil status and profile, 
(iii) complete any form and sign any agreement presented as mandatory on the Site,

IGIA reserves the right to suspend the Client/Investor/Member's access to 
the Website or the Personal Space, or to restricted access pages or Services, and/or 
to terminate this Agreement with respect to the Client/Member/Investor with immediate effect.

IGIA'S COMPENSATION
IGIA'S compensation is derived from fees charged to the Financed Companies. 
This compensation is due to IGIA upon publication of the Project on the 
Website and becomes payable upon transfer of funds to the Financed Company's bank account.

The services provided to each Client/Member/Investor are free of charge. 
IGIA, however, reserves the right to charge the Client/Member/Investor a 
transaction fee in the following case: if a Client credits their Payment 
Account on IGIA and then debits it without investing. In this case, 1% of the debited amount may be charged.
